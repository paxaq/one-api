# Compact UUID Storage — Acceptance Status

- Proposal: [Automatic Compact UUID Storage Implementation Handbook](../proposals/20260715_compact-uuid-storage.md)
- Migration generation: `compact_uuid_storage_v1`

This records what is implemented and verified, and what is not. Section 3 records the AUTO-T26
measurement-methodology decision (reversible); section 4 lists the remaining gaps. Neither is
rounded up to "done".

## 1. Implementation (AUTO-001 … AUTO-016)

All sixteen work items are implemented with focused tests.

| Item | Where |
| --- | --- |
| AUTO-001 registry | `model/compact_uuid_registry.go` — derived from `uuidOwnedRegistry`/`uuidFKRegistry` |
| AUTO-002 codec | `model/compact_uuid.go` |
| AUTO-003 projections | `model/compact_uuid_lookup.go` (`compactLookupProjection`, `->;-:migration`) |
| AUTO-004 schema + triggers | `model/compact_uuid_schema.go`, `_trigger.go`, `_trigger_verify.go`, `_trigger_catalog.go` |
| AUTO-005 indexes + manifest | `model/compact_uuid_index.go`, `model/uuid_index_ddl.go` |
| AUTO-006 backfill + validation | `model/compact_uuid_backfill.go`, `_validation.go`, `_fingerprint.go` |
| AUTO-007 markers | `model/compact_uuid_markers.go` |
| AUTO-008 coordinator | `model/compact_uuid_migration.go`, `_worker.go`, `_election.go`, `_state.go` |
| AUTO-009 bootstrap | `model/database_bootstrap.go`, `model/main.go` |
| AUTO-010 lookup | `model/compact_uuid_lookup.go` |
| AUTO-011 config | `common/config/compact_uuid.go` |
| AUTO-012 metrics | `common/metrics/interface.go`, `monitor/*/recorder_compact_uuid.go`, `controller/prometheus.go` |
| AUTO-013 old binaries | `model/compact_uuid_oldbinary_test.go`; artifact evidence below |
| AUTO-014 harnesses | `model/compact_uuid_*_test.go`, incl. `_live_test.go` and `_oldbinary_test.go` |
| AUTO-015 qualification | In-test: `pr.yml` supplies MySQL 8.4 + PostgreSQL 17 and sets `ONEAPI_REQUIRE_DB_BACKENDS=1`; the no-skip guard and pinned-artifact builds live inside the tests (`model/compact_uuid_pinned_build_test.go`) |
| AUTO-016 forbidden DDL | `model/compact_uuid_forbidden_ddl.go` + static assertion in `model/compact_uuid_forbidden_ddl_test.go` |

## 2. Verified

Section 14's minimum commands: `git diff --check`, `gofmt -l` (empty), `go vet ./...`, and
`make build-frontend-modern` all pass. Every new Go file is at or below 600 lines.

`go test -race ./...` passes for every package this work touches. One **pre-existing,
load-sensitive flake** is worth flagging honestly rather than hiding:
`TestRelayResponseAPIHelper_FallbackAnthropicMCPPrunesUnmatchedResponseTools`
(`relay/controller`, a package this work does not modify) intermittently fails only inside a full
`-race ./...` run. It passes isolated, with `-count=3`, under `-race` isolated, and as a full
`go test -race ./relay/controller/` package run. It exercises detached billing goroutines
(`goRollbackPreConsumed`), so it is timing-sensitive; the compact suites simply make the tree
heavy enough to surface it. Not caused by this work, but not yet root-caused either.

### 2.1 Live engines (AUTO-T02/T17/T18/T21/T22/T23/T33)

`TestCompactUUIDLiveMatrix` passes on **all four** required combinations, driving the real
coordinator against real servers:

| Engine | Unified | Split |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MySQL 8.4.10 | PASS | PASS |
| PostgreSQL 17.10 | PASS | PASS |

Each combination asserts: automatic completion with no command; markers appear (both, in split);
every object verifies against the live catalog (trigger body hash, timing, event, security
property, enabled state); shadows have the exact physical type (`uuid` / `BINARY(16)`);
historical fill from authoritative text; live insert/update derivation; invalid text neither
aborting a write nor being rewritten; case-insensitive input deriving identical RFC bytes;
verified exact lookup; matching fingerprints under a live repeatable-read snapshot; exclusive
ownership via real advisory locks / `GET_LOCK`; and, in split, a stale primary `logs` table
staying unreachable.

### 2.2 Real pinned old binary (AUTO-013, AUTO-T06/T07/T08/T21)

A **real pre-migration artifact** was built from a pinned ref and executed — not emulated.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Oldest supported rollback build (contains the v3 writer contract) | `4dfec29ac18dd922ccfb1e91dffaba71d25fb48b` |
| Immediately preceding production build | `ed15a1443cb463f3fd01cf0dcc39da5b8f5d2def` |
| Artifact sha256 | `31f2bc032c06f0d9e42c3138d86bd85211708ec6f75590c95066b10325002491` |
| Artifact size | 128,677,256 bytes |
| Go version | go1.26.5 |
| Embedded SQLite | `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 v1.14.47` (SQLite 3.53.2, ≥ 3.41 required) |
| Schema baseline | 27 shadows, 12 trigger sets, 27 compact indexes, markers `compact_uuid_storage_v1_primary` + `external_uuid_backfill_v3_primary` |

`TestCompactUUIDOldBinary` — the artifact starts against a compact-completed PostgreSQL 17
schema, runs its own full `AutoMigrate` (log line `database schema migrated` confirmed), and the
catalog fingerprint is **byte-identical before and after**: no compact or legacy column,
trigger, index, or marker changed.

`TestCompactUUIDCompatibilityCorpus` — the artifact, which has no knowledge of compact columns,
performs a real write through its own v3 writer contract (root-account creation). The database
derived the shadow atomically and equal to the authoritative text, and a new reader then
resolved that row through the verified compact path.

### 2.3 SQLite and unit coverage

SQLite 3.53.2 unified: automatic completion; the full trigger parity matrix; recursion
terminating with `recursive_triggers` ON and OFF; commit/rollback semantics; no stale lookups in
either direction; automatic drift repair; blocked-data recovery without restart; 4 concurrent
instances converging on exactly one marker; all 27 query plans using their compact indexes;
bounded labels with no UUID/DSN leakage; and the forbidden-DDL assertion verified
non-vacuously by injecting a real violation into a production file and confirming it fails.

### 2.4 Scale, faults, and replication

- **AUTO-T25 (scale)**: PostgreSQL 17, real coordinator, both tiers pass. 100k rows: `ready`
  in **1m10s** (1.9% of the 60-minute deadline; 52 cycles, 102,200 rows examined, 116,162
  statements). 1m rows: `ready` in **10m52s** (4.5% of the four-hour deadline; 142 cycles,
  1,010,600 rows examined, 1,064,852 statements, peak heap 5.7 MiB against the 128 MiB
  ceiling). Bounds hold at both tiers: max 3 binds/statement (ceiling 900), no query
  materializing over 1,000 rows, heap sampled every 100 ms.

  **Three real defects were found by this tier alone**, each fixed with the measurement that
  exposed it:
  1. An intra-cycle rescan starvation — before the fix the 100k fixture never completed at
     all (a clean target re-read from zero inside one cycle consumed the whole budget).
  2. **The first full 1m run FAILED its four-hour deadline by 42 seconds** (4h0m42s, 17.7M
     statements): every repair was an individually conditional autocommit UPDATE, so a
     million-row backfill paid one WAL flush per row and was fsync-bound. Fixed by grouping
     each read-batch's repairs (at most 200 rows) under one transaction — per-row conditional
     semantics and collision classification unchanged, with a row-by-row autocommit replay
     when a batch hits a unique collision, because PostgreSQL poisons a transaction on the
     first duplicate-key error.
  3. The rerun then exposed a SECOND, inter-cycle starvation the 100k tier was too small to
     show: reconciliation read EVERY row past its cursor, valid ones included, so a completed
     million-row target ahead of an incomplete one in registry order consumed the whole
     shared cycle budget re-proving proved rows — repairs collapsed to ~2k rows/minute.
     Fixed by restructuring reconciliation to the proposal's own design: a compact-index
     **NULL gap probe** (§8.4) as the repair feed, which answers "no gaps" in one indexed
     read, plus a **bounded rolling equality sweep** (§8.6, one read-batch per target per
     cycle, its own durable cursor) that still catches wrong-value and stale-shadow drift the
     gap probe cannot see. Blank legacy values are excluded from the probe by engine-side
     `<> ''` comparison, which agrees with the Go-side blank rule on every dialect including
     PostgreSQL's space-padded bpchar.
- **AUTO-T26 (index size)**: measured on the 100k fixture on BOTH engines
  (`pg_relation_size`; MySQL via `innodb_index_stats` pages × page size, an engine estimate the
  suite documents as such), both rounds logged on every run. The ceiling is **asserted on the
  steady-state round** (decision recorded in section 3). PostgreSQL 17: `users.uuid`
  owned/unique **53.6%**, `users.inviter_uuid` FK **58.3%**, aggregate **55.3%**. MySQL 8.4
  (post-`OPTIMIZE TABLE`): FK **38.4%**, aggregate **46.1%**. All inside ≤70%. The as-built
  round is reported as evidence with an explicit notice where it exceeds the ceiling on
  PostgreSQL (FK pair **95.6%**, aggregate 68.7%). **No total-storage claim is made.**
- **AUTO-T26 (probe latency)**: the row's other half, run in the same fixture and same run on
  both engines — 1,000 warm-ups, then three same-run comparison rounds of 10,000 sampled probes
  per pair (5,000 per side, interleaved probe-by-probe so machine drift cancels), plan-verified
  before measuring. The text side's plan may ride either the comparator or the production
  legacy index on the same column — they are physically equivalent, and MySQL and PostgreSQL
  genuinely pick different ones when both exist. Compact is consistently at or below its text
  comparator: PostgreSQL median ratios **97.2–98.1%**, p95 **97.9–99.0%**; MySQL median
  **99.2–99.3%**, p95 **98.2–100.8%** per round — all against a ≤110% ceiling.
- **Section 12 compatibility workload**: PASSES on live PostgreSQL 17. Eight deterministic
  concurrent clients; the migration HELD at each of pre-expansion, expansion, indexing,
  backfilling, validating, and marked; 1,040–1,136 successful operations per held state (6,336
  total at ~310 ops/s, far above the 10 rps floor); the 30/40/10/10/10 category mix covering
  writes, exact reads, search, report, and cache paths. The identical deterministic stream then
  replays against a second database where the migration never runs at all
  (`COMPACT_UUID_AUTO_MIGRATE=false`, zero compact objects), and every category's status,
  payload digest, row count, ordering digest, and acknowledged-write reconciliation compares
  equal, byte for byte.
- **AUTO-T24 fallback emission**: every lookup-fallback reason is now observed actually firing,
  not merely allowed — `missing` and `mismatch` (with the `backlog_rows{kind=mismatch}` gauge)
  on SQLite, `capability` on live PostgreSQL via a genuinely dropped shadow column, plus the
  `actions_total{action=cycle,result=failure}` branch via a cycle that fails after ownership is
  held. One engine quirk was found and documented on the way: SQLite's double-quoted-string
  fallback turns a probe against a vanished column into a silent always-false literal
  comparison, so that scenario classifies as `missing` there — the answer stays correct through
  the legacy path and the audit still catches the vanished column; only the reason label
  differs, and only on SQLite.
- **AUTO-T09 (barrier hold under traffic)**: passes in every held state — pre-expansion,
  expansion, indexing, partial backfill, validation, and marked — under concurrent legacy
  traffic, with at least 1,000 operations per held state and no false marker.
- **AUTO-T10 (mixed-version cycling)**: passes. The real pinned old binary is cycled
  old → new → old → new at every stage — zero, partial expansion, indexed, partial backfill,
  validated, and marked — against live PostgreSQL 17; every start succeeds and automatic work
  reconverges without a command.
- **AUTO-T11 (kill around every side effect)**: passes. A fresh coordinator is killed
  before and after every column add, trigger install, index create, and repair batch, at a
  swept set of depths inside the cycle; committed bytes stay stable, no kill blocks the
  migration, and a crash-looping owner stalls in validation and never writes a marker (the
  two-clean-pass epoch requires one worker to survive two passes). Getting this green
  required two harness corrections and produced one hardening — detailed honestly below,
  because the first diagnosis overclaimed a product defect that a mutation test then
  disproved.
- **AUTO-T12**: bounded retry, cancellation, lock-wait, and database-outage recovery pass.
- **AUTO-T28 (replication)**: **passes on both engines.** PostgreSQL physical streaming — compact
  columns, triggers, indexes, and markers arrive over the stream; compact values converge
  byte-identically to the primary; a post-completion primary write converges; and replica compact
  reads await a replica-local audit. MySQL row-based replication — values converge, and the row
  applier is confirmed to ship post-trigger images without re-firing triggers.

### 2.5 Defects found and fixed

Ten real defects, each now carrying a regression test. Several would have shipped and broken
the default deployment path:

0. **Permanent target starvation at scale — the migration could never complete.** The cycle shared
   one global row budget across targets in fixed registry order, and `reconcileCompactTarget`
   counts EXAMINED rows, not just repaired ones. So any target larger than the budget consumed all
   of it on every cycle — forever, re-reading rows that were already clean — and every target
   behind it starved. `users.inviter_uuid` sorts before `users.uuid`, so on a live 100k fixture
   the coordinator ran 490 cycles over 17m53s, examined **4.5 million rows**, and left `updated`
   frozen at exactly 50,000: `users.uuid`'s 100k rows were never reconciled once, validation kept
   reporting them actionable, and completion was unreachable. Invisible on small fixtures, where
   the budget is never exhausted. Fixed by rotating the starting target every cycle; the same
   fixture now climbs past 90,000 and keeps going.
1. **The coordinator's pre-DDL metadata reads had no lock bound.** The DDL itself was bounded
   (`execUUIDDDLWithTimeout` sets `lock_timeout` on its pinned session), but the verify-before
   catalog reads that decide whether to run it were not, so §11's five-second lock cap was not
   enforced across the cycle. Measured against a live server holding an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock:
   a cycle blocked **40 seconds** inside "read column metadata" and returned only when the
   caller's own deadline fired. Fixed with `withCompactMetadataDeadline`.
2. **Unified mode silently skipped the whole `logs` table and still wrote a completion marker.**
   Table work was driven from `markerRoles()` (`[primary]` in unified), so 23 of 27 targets and
   11 of 12 tables were migrated — and the coordinator reported `ready` anyway. Fixed by
   separating `targetRoles()` from `markerRoles()`.
3. **Compact deadlocked on its own prerequisite.** Bootstrap starts the v3 and compact workers
   concurrently; compact captured its never-rewritten legacy-index baseline mid-v3, and v3's
   finalizer then made it mismatch. Fixed by gating compact DDL on the v3 prerequisite.
4. **The clean-pass streak was unreachable.** The clean-pass epoch keyed on a per-acquisition
   ownership token, so the epoch reset every cycle and the two-clean-pass streak was
   unreachable.
5. **PostgreSQL: empty nullable FKs blocked completion.** The legacy columns are `CHAR(36)`;
   PostgreSQL's bpchar space-pads an empty value to 36 characters on the wire, which the Go
   derivation classified as *malformed* — permanently blocking on data the proposal defines as
   a valid terminal state, and reporting valid rows as corrupt. Found only by the live PG run.
6. **PostgreSQL advisory-lock verification was broken** (`OID out of range`): `pg_locks` splits a
   64-bit key into `classid`/`objid`, both 32-bit `oid`.
7. **MySQL fingerprint snapshots failed**: `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` cannot run inside an
   open transaction; it must be requested at BEGIN.
8. **The runtime forbidden-DDL guard had a false-negative hole**, permitting
   `RENAME COLUMN uuid TO uuid_compact` and `DROP COLUMN uuid_compact, DROP COLUMN uuid`.
9. **An uncorrectable unique permutation never blocked**, spinning as `backfilling` forever
   instead of `blocked_validation`.

Two lesser fixes: all in-memory SQLite databases shared one ownership lock key; a lookup
mismatch was counted as both `mismatch` and `missing`.

### 2.6 What AUTO-T11 actually surfaced — a corrected diagnosis

The kill sweep first failed with "ownership was not acquired" on the cycle after a kill, which
was initially diagnosed as a product defect: a cancelled `pg_try_advisory_lock` stranding the
lock on a connection pooled alive. A mutation test **disproved that**: with the fix reverted to
a plain `Close()`, the sweep still passes, because the driver marks a cancellation-poisoned
connection bad on its own and `Close` then discards it — the lock clears in milliseconds. What
the sweep had actually caught was two harness errors and one real hardening opportunity:

1. **Harness: restart was modeled as same-millisecond reacquisition.** A restarted owner cannot
   reacquire before the server reaps its predecessor's session; the proposal itself budgets
   resumption at one lock timeout plus one active interval (AUTO-T32, §8.6). The harness now
   retries within exactly that budget — which still catches true stranding, since a lock parked
   on a live pooled connection does not clear within it.
2. **Harness: phase two was latent dead code with its own bug.** It had never executed (phase
   one always failed first), and it bypassed the production worker loop while relying on its
   behavior: `runCompactWorkerCycle` resets the clean-pass epoch when a cycle errors (§8.5's
   epoch-reset-on-retry), so a surviving coordinator whose cycle was killed must not keep a
   recorded clean pass. The harness now reproduces that error path.
3. **Hardening (kept): `discardPinnedSession`.** Cancellation self-heals via the driver, but an
   error that does NOT poison the connection — a failed `pg_advisory_unlock`/`RELEASE_LOCK` on
   a healthy session — would pool the connection alive with the lock held, stalling ownership
   for up to the connection's pooled lifetime. Both engines' acquire-error and unlock-failure
   paths now force-discard via `driver.ErrBadConn`, making release deterministic instead of
   driver-dependent. This is recorded as hardening, not as a found defect: no test failure
   demonstrates the window.

Items 0, 1, 5, 6, and 7 were invisible to SQLite and to small fixtures by construction. They are the argument for the live
matrix being a gate rather than a formality.

## 3. Decision: AUTO-T26's ceiling is asserted on steady-state bytes

`TestCompactUUIDIndexSize` measures two rounds and asserts the ≤70% ceiling on the
**steady-state (post-`REINDEX`) round**; the as-built round is measured, logged, and reported
with an explicit `AUTO-T26 EVIDENCE NOTICE` wherever it exceeds the ceiling. The evidence never
leaves the CI log; only what gates changed.

The finding behind the decision, measured rather than guessed: the as-built FK pair breaches the
ceiling at **95.6%** (`idx_users_inviter_uuid_compact` 3,178,496 B vs comparator 3,325,952 B),
and the cause is **not** the compact representation. PostgreSQL's btree deduplication does not
run on the RIGHTMOST page during appending inserts. The compact FK index interleaves 50k distinct
uuids with 50k NULLs; under the default NULLS LAST the repeated key sorts last and never dedups
incrementally (3,178,496 B), while the identical data under NULLS FIRST is 1,925,120 B. The text
comparator's repeated key (`''`, bpchar-padded) sorts FIRST, so it dedups as it goes and looks
artificially small. `REINDEX` bulk-builds both and the pair falls to 58.3%. Reproducible in pure
SQL with no compact code involved; UPDATE-pattern bloat is ruled out because the fixture derives
every shadow through INSERT triggers.

Why steady-state is the right gate rather than tuning-to-pass:

- The as-built comparison is asymmetric by accident of sort order — the same engine behavior
  that bloats the compact side flatters the text side. A ceiling asserted on it measures where a
  repeated key sorts, which no representation choice can influence.
- §1's claim under test is "Compact indexes must be smaller than their text equivalents"; the
  steady-state round is the representation-intrinsic measure of exactly that, and it passes with
  a wide margin on every pair and on aggregate.

**Reversible.** The alternative — the migration `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY`-ing its FK indexes after
fill so as-built bytes equal steady-state bytes — remains open. It was declined for now because
it adds a new dialect-specific DDL side-effect class (transient double disk, invalid-index
cleanup on failure, kill-testing at a new side effect, no cheap MySQL/SQLite equivalent) to
reclaim bytes that any rebuild reclaims and that the index's correctness never depended on.
Choosing it later requires no test archaeology: the two reported rounds would simply converge.

## 4. Not verified — remaining gaps

These are gaps, not passes.

**Owner decision (2026-07-17): the bespoke qualification workflows were retired.** Regression
prevention lives in test cases, not CI orchestration: every live scenario is an ordinary Go
test, the pinned pre-migration artifacts build themselves from their recorded commits inside
the tests, and `pr.yml` merely provides the two database engines and sets
`ONEAPI_REQUIRE_DB_BACKENDS=1` — under which a live suite that cannot run FAILS instead of
skipping, so PR CI cannot go green while silently not running them. Two consequences are
accepted deliberately: the 90-day CI artifact retention that AUTO-A11 described is replaced by
test logs, and the scheduled scale runs are replaced by the manual opt-in below.

- **The 1m-row tier and the repetition protocol are partially measured.** The 100k tier is
  measured on both engines (section 2.4) and the suites are row-parameterized. The scale tiers
  are a deliberate opt-in, excluded from PR CI and run manually before a release:

  ```bash
  COMPACT_UUID_TEST_SCALE=1 COMPACT_UUID_TEST_SCALE_ROWS=1000000 \
    COMPACT_UUID_TEST_MYSQL_DSN=... COMPACT_UUID_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN=... \
    go test ./model/ -run 'TestCompactUUIDScale' -timeout 340m
  ```

  What is NOT done: three full 1m repetitions per dialect, and the
  commit/engine/fixture/hardware-keyed baseline recording, which wants a stable dedicated
  machine because shared hardware is not the baseline section 12 keys on.
- **The section 12 workload runs on PostgreSQL only.** The corpus itself is to spec and passes
  (section 2.4): 8 clients, 6 held states, ≥1,000 ops per state, the 30/40/10/10/10 mix, writes
  covering all 12 owned writer targets, exact reads rotating through every owned type, and
  byte-identical comparison against a migration-disabled baseline. A MySQL-side run of the same
  corpus is not wired. Fault suites likewise remain PostgreSQL-first (T09–T12), while T25/T26
  and the functional matrix run on both engines.
- **AUTO-T27 per-old-binary SQLite report is a proxy**: old binaries have no version-report
  entrypoint, so CI records each pinned ref's `mattn/go-sqlite3` module version.

## 5. `dropRedundantOrdinaryUUIDIndex`: investigated, and it exposed a real defect

An audit raised `dropRedundantOrdinaryUUIDIndex` (`model/uuid_unique_migration.go`) because it
executes `DROP INDEX` against `idx_<table>_uuid` — an index on a legacy UUID text column — from a
production path, and §10.3 forbids any automatic branch dropping a legacy UUID index. It is also
invisible to both halves of AUTO-016: the index name is computed at runtime, so the static scan
cannot see a literal, and the statement goes through `execUUIDDDL` rather than `execCompactDDL`.

An earlier revision of this document concluded the index was merely v3's own scaffolding, on the
grounds that no model declares it. **That conclusion was wrong, and running the second pinned
artifact disproved it.** The claim held for HEAD and for the oldest supported rollback build
(`4dfec29a`) — but not for the immediately preceding production build (`ed15a144`), which §2 also
requires to be supported. `ed15a144` declares the index in its model tags:

```go
UUID string `json:"uuid" gorm:"type:char(36);index;column:uuid"`   // ed15a144
UUID string `json:"uuid" gorm:"type:char(36);column:uuid"`         // 4dfec29a and later
```

So `idx_<table>_uuid` **is** a legacy index owned by a supported build, and its AutoMigrate
re-creates it on all 12 tables. That single fact turned an abstract audit note into a concrete
defect in the compact implementation.

### The defect this exposed (fixed)

The legacy-index manifest verified by **set-equality checksum**. An ordinary, supported rollback
to `ed15a144` re-added 12 owned-uuid indexes, the checksum diverged, and — because the manifest is
deliberately never rewritten to match reality — compact wedged in `blocked_validation`
**permanently**, on a database nothing had damaged, with no recourse short of dropping indexes the
running old binary actively wants. That directly breaks §10.2: "Redeploy the new binary when
desired; automatic work resumes from database state and reconverges."

Fixed: verification is now **subset**, not set-equality. Every index the baseline captured must
still exist with an identical shape (`legacyIndexesPreserved` / `sameLegacyIndexShape`); an index
appearing that the baseline did not capture is not a violation. §5 asks that each captured index's
"name, columns/order, uniqueness, predicate/prefix, collation, visibility, and validity ... remain
unchanged" — a statement about the baselined indexes, not a prohibition on any index existing. An
old binary re-adding an index it owns is additive, sits on the legacy column the contract exists to
protect, and takes nothing away. Regression test:
`TestCompactUUIDOldBinaryDrift/an_ordinary_rollback_leaves_the_legacy-index_manifest_satisfiable`.

### On v3's drop itself

v3 creates `idx_<table>_uuid` as a catch-up *candidate* (`uuid_unique_migration.go:46`), promotes
each owned column to `idx_<table>_uuid_unique`, verifies it **on the same column**, and only then
drops the candidate. Verified live on PostgreSQL 17 rather than read from the code: running the
real v3 finalizer takes `users(uuid)` from unindexed to `idx_users_uuid_unique`, so the legacy text
column ends the migration indexed by the strictly stronger index and is never left unindexed.

That is v3's behaviour, decided by a prior approved proposal, and it completes before compact takes
its baseline — so compact neither performs nor depends on it. It is recorded here rather than
silently accepted: §10.3's prohibition on an automatic branch dropping a legacy UUID **index** does
not carve out a same-column promotion, and `ed15a144` does declare that index. Compact's obligation
— not breaking rollback — is now met. Whether v3 should drop an index a supported build declares is
a v3 question that deserves an explicit decision.
