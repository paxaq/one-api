# One API

## Synopsis

Open‑source version of OpenRouter, managed through a unified gateway that handles all AI SaaS model calls. Core functions include:

1. Aggregating chat, image, speech, TTS, embeddings, rerank and other capabilities.
2. Aggregating multiple model providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Google Vertex, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Replicate, AWS Bedrock, Groq, Grok/xAI, Fireworks, NVIDIA, Cerebras, Cloudflare, ZHIPU GLM, Cohere, etc.
3. Aggregating various upstream API request formats like Chat Completion, Response, Claude Messages.
4. Supporting different request formats; users can issue requests via Chat Completion, Response, or Claude Messages, which are automatically and transparently converted to the native request format of the upstream model. Even if the client sends a mismatched request format to wrong api endpoint, it will still be correctly processed.
5. Supporting multi‑tenant management, allowing each tenant to set distinct quotas and permissions.
6. Supporting generation of sub‑API Keys; each tenant can create multiple sub‑API Keys, each of which can be bound to different models and quotas.

Also welcome to register and use my deployed one-api gateway, which supports various mainstream models. For usage instructions, please refer to <https://wiki.laisky.com/projects/gpt/pay/>.

Try it at <https://oneapi.laisky.com>, login with `root` / `123456`. 🚀

> 📖 **API reference** — see [docs/manuals/api_references.md](docs/manuals/api_references.md) for the complete HTTP API: authentication, conventions, errors, and every endpoint with `curl` examples, organized for both end-users (inference + API-key management) and administrators.

## Tutorial

### Docker Compose Deployment

Docker images available on Docker Hub:

- `ppcelery/one-api:latest`
- `ppcelery/one-api:arm64-latest`

The initial default account and password are `root` / `123456`. Listening port can be configured via the `PORT` environment variable, default is `3000`.

Run one-api using docker-compose:

> All environment variables can be set via the `environment` section in the `docker-compose.yml` file, please refer to [./common/config/config.go](./common/config/config.go) for all available configuration options.

```yaml
oneapi:
  image: ppcelery/one-api:latest
  restart: unless-stopped
  logging:
    driver: 'json-file'
    options:
      max-size: '10m'
  environment:
    # ⚠️ Only set ENABLE_COOKIE_SECURE=false for HTTP deployments; keep it true for HTTPS to ensure session security
    - ENABLE_COOKIE_SECURE=false
  volumes:
    - /var/lib/oneapi:/data
  ports:
    - 3000:3000
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Session cookies are marked `Secure` by default, so the browser will only send them over HTTPS. If you are serving the service over plain HTTP (for example accessing `http://<host>:3000` directly, or a reverse proxy that terminates HTTPS but is misconfigured), logins will appear to succeed but the next request is unauthenticated, looping the user back to the login page. In that case set `ENABLE_COOKIE_SECURE=false` in the `environment` section. Keep it at the default (`true`) for any production deployment served over HTTPS.

### Kubernetes Deployment

The Kubernetes deployment guide has been moved into a dedicated document:

## New Features

### Universal Features

#### I18n Support

Support internationalization (i18n) in the web frontend, including English, Chinese, French, Spanish, and Japanese.

#### Unified Billing System

All channels share a four-layer billing pipeline (channel overrides → adapter defaults → global fallback → safe default) with support for tiered token pricing, time-of-day pricing windows, cached prompt buckets, and per-second/per-image media meters. Administrators can fetch defaults, override specific models, and audit every call via `X-Oneapi-Request-Id`; see [docs/arch/billing.md](./docs/arch/billing.md) for internals and [docs/manuals/billing.md](./docs/manuals/billing.md) for the operational playbook.

Per-channel `model_configs` can define `ratio`, `completion_ratio`, cache-read/cache-write ratios, `tiers`, `time_windows`, `max_tokens`, and media pricing blocks (`video`, `audio`, `image`, `embedding`). `time_windows` are ordered wall-clock overlays with explicit timezones; the first matching window at request start time is merged before tiers, so streaming requests keep one consistent rate even when they cross a boundary.

Marketplace and aggregation-channel pricing snapshots such as OpenRouter, Together AI, Fireworks, Replicate, Cloudflare, and Novita are maintained from official provider docs or machine-readable official APIs rather than third-party trackers.

#### Support Open Telemetry

```sh
# set environment variables
OTEL_ENABLED="true"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://otel-collector:4317"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE="true"
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="one-api"
OTEL_ENVIRONMENT="debug"
```

#### Support channel's built-in tooling configuration

Configure the price and whitelist for a channel’s built‑in tools.

![tooling-config](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2025/11/oneapi-channel-tools.png)

#### Support update user's remained quota

You can update the used quota using the API key of any token, allowing other consumption to be aggregated into the one-api for centralized management.

```sh
curl -X POST https://oneapi.laisky.com/api/token/consume \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "add_reason": "async-transcode",
    "add_used_quota": 150
  }'
```

[> Read More](./docs/manuals/external_billing.md)

#### Get request's cost

Each chat completion request will include a `X-Oneapi-Request-Id` in the returned headers. You can use this request id to request `GET /api/cost/request/:request_id` to get the cost of this request.

The returned structure is:

```go
type UserRequestCost struct {
  Id          int     `json:"id"`
  CreatedTime int64   `json:"created_time" gorm:"bigint"`
  UserID      int     `json:"user_id"`
  RequestID   string  `json:"request_id"`
  Quota       int64   `json:"quota"`
  CostUSD     float64 `json:"cost_usd" gorm:"-"`
}
```

#### Support Tracing info in logs

#### Support Cached Input

Now supports cached input, which can significantly reduce the cost.

![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2025/08/cached_input.png)

##### Support Anthropic Prompt caching

- <https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching>

#### Automatically Enable Thinking and Customize Reasoning Format via URL Parameters

Supports two URL parameters: `thinking` and `reasoning_format`.

- `thinking`: Whether to enable thinking mode, disabled by default.
- `reasoning_format`: Specifies the format of the returned reasoning.
  - `reasoning_content`: DeepSeek official API format, returned in the `reasoning_content` field.
  - `reasoning`: OpenRouter format, returned in the `reasoning` field.
  - `thinking`: Claude format, returned in the `thinking` field.

OpenAI Chat Completions, Response API, and Claude Messages requests also accept an `extra_body` object for allowlisted provider-specific passthrough fields. OneAPI flattens allowlisted keys into the upstream root payload, preserves explicit top-level request fields, and rejects malformed or non-allowlisted entries.

##### Reasoning Format - reasoning-content

```sh
curl --location 'https://oneapi.laisky.com/v1/chat/completions?thinking=true&reasoning_format=reasoning_content' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: sk-xxxxxxx' \
  --data '{
    "model": "gpt-5-mini",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "1+1=?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Response:

#### MCP Aggregators

Supports adding MCP servers as tool aggregators, which are then provided to downstream models as built-in tools. This enables clients to call any MCP tool with any model.

Features include MCP server addition, automatic MCP tool synchronization, billing, load balancing, automatic retries, and logging.

Additionally, one-api itself can act as an MCP server, aggregating all MCP tools via the `/mcp` endpoint.

[Read Mode...](./docs/manuals/mcp_aggregator.md)

```sh
# MCP servers integrate the web_search and web_fetch tools, allowing any model that supports tools to invoke them

### Anthropic (Claude) Features

#### (Merged) Support aws claude

- [feat: support aws bedrockruntime claude3 #1328](https://github.com/Laisky/one-api/pull/1328)
- [feat: add new claude models #1910](https://github.com/Laisky/one-api/pull/1910)

![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/12/oneapi-claude.png)

#### Support claude-3-7-sonnet & thinking

- [feat: support claude-3-7-sonnet #2143](https://github.com/Laisky/one-api/pull/2143/files)
- [feat: support claude thinking #2144](https://github.com/Laisky/one-api/pull/2144)

By default, the thinking mode is not enabled. You need to manually pass the `thinking` field in the request body to enable it.

##### Stream

##### Non-Stream

![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2025/02/claude-thinking-non-stream.png)

#### Support /v1/messages Claude Messages API

![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2025/07/claude_messages.png)

##### Support Claude Code

```sh
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="openai/gpt-oss-120b"
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://oneapi.laisky.com/"
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="sk-xxxxxxx"
```

You can use any model you like for Claude Code, even if the model doesn’t natively support the Claude Messages API.

#### Support Azure AI Foundry Claude models

[Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/how-to/use-foundry-models-claude) serves Anthropic Claude through the native Anthropic Messages API — there is no OpenAI-compatible route for Claude on Foundry. one-api's existing **Azure** channel handles this automatically: on an Azure channel, `claude-*` models are routed to the resource's `/anthropic/v1/messages` surface (with the `x-api-key` and `anthropic-version` headers and Anthropic pricing), while `gpt-*` deployments continue to use the Azure OpenAI surface. No separate channel type is required.

To use it:

1. Create an **Azure** channel and set the base URL to your resource endpoint, e.g. `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com` (no `/anthropic` or `/openai` suffix — one-api appends the correct path per model).
2. Use the Azure resource key as the channel key (forwarded as `x-api-key`).
3. Add the Claude models you deployed (e.g. `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-opus-4-8`). Naming your Azure deployment to match the one-api model id lets both routing and default Anthropic pricing resolve automatically. If the deployment name differs, add a model mapping (`claude-* → your-deployment`); routing still works because it keys off the requested model, but you should then set a per-channel price for the deployment name so billing stays correct.

[opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai) is an AI coding agent built for the terminal. OpenCode is fully open source, giving you control and `freedom` to use any provider, any model, and any editor. It's available as both a CLI and TUI.

One‑API integrates seamlessly with OpenCode: you can connect any One‑API endpoint and use all your unified models through OpenCode's interface (both CLI and TUI).

To get started, create or edit `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` like this:

#### Support black-forest-labs/flux-kontext-pro

![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2025/05/flux-kontext-pro.png)

### NVIDIA Features

#### Support NVIDIA API Catalog (build.nvidia.com)

Adds an `NVIDIA` channel type that targets NVIDIA's OpenAI-compatible hosted inference API at `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` (the models published on [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/models)). Authenticate with an `nvapi-...` API key. The channel serves Chat Completions natively, and transparently handles Claude Messages / Response API requests through one-api's OpenAI-compatible conversion layer. Embeddings are not enabled by default until NVIDIA's model-specific request requirements are represented in the catalog.

Curated models include NVIDIA's own Nemotron family (e.g. `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b`, `nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5`, `nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl`) plus popular hosted open models such as `meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`, `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash`, `qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, and `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6`.

NVIDIA does not publish per-token pricing for the hosted endpoint (it is metered in free API credits rather than currency), so every bundled model defaults to free. Operators routing to NVIDIA AI Enterprise or a paid partner endpoint with real costs can set per-channel pricing overrides.

### Cerebras Features

#### Support Cerebras Inference (api.cerebras.ai)

Adds a `Cerebras` channel type that targets [Cerebras Inference](https://inference-docs.cerebras.ai/), the OpenAI-compatible API served on Cerebras' wafer-scale (CS-3) hardware at `https://api.cerebras.ai/v1`. Authenticate with a Cerebras API key (`Authorization: Bearer ...`). The channel serves Chat Completions natively, and transparently handles Claude Messages / Response API requests through one-api's OpenAI-compatible conversion layer. Cerebras is chat-only — it does not expose embeddings or a native Anthropic Messages endpoint.

Bundled models (live on the shared public API with officially published per-token pricing):

- `gpt-oss-120b` — OpenAI gpt-oss 120B open-weight MoE reasoning model (Production / GA); 131K context, tools and structured outputs, `reasoning_effort` supported. Billed at $0.35 / 1M input and $0.75 / 1M output tokens.
- `zai-glm-4.7` — Z.ai GLM-4.7 (355B) reasoning/agent model; 131K context. Marked **Preview** by Cerebras (evaluation only, may change on short notice). Billed at $2.25 / 1M input and $2.75 / 1M output tokens.
- `gemma-4-31b` — Google Gemma 4 31B multimodal (text + image input) reasoning model; 131K context (paid tier), reasoning disabled by default (opt-in via `reasoning_effort`). Marked **Preview** by Cerebras. Billed at $0.99 / 1M input and $1.49 / 1M output tokens.

Per-token rates above are taken from the official Cerebras model cards; operators can override pricing per channel.
