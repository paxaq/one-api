package model

// Fault-injection, barrier-hold, and mixed-version qualification for compact UUID storage
// (AUTO-T09/T10/T11/T12; proposal sections 8.4, 8.6, and 10.2). Fixtures live in
// compact_uuid_fault_harness_test.go.
//
// Everything here drives the REAL coordinator against a REAL PostgreSQL 17 server. Nothing
// emulates a trigger, a catalog read, or a marker write in Go: the interesting failures of a
// fault suite live in the engine's half of the contract — a DDL that half-committed, a pool
// that kept a dead socket, a lock wait that outlived its bound — and an emulation would fake
// exactly those.
//
// How a "kill" is simulated, and why it is honest: killing `go test` itself would take the
// assertions with it, so a kill is modelled as the two things a real SIGKILL costs the
// coordinator, applied together — the cycle's context is cancelled, so in-flight statements die
// exactly as they would when the process vanishes, AND the *compactCoordinator is discarded, so
// the restart begins with the empty cursors, zero clean-pass streak, and fresh worker token a
// new process gets. Section 8.4's "one attempt per side effect per cycle" makes this precise:
// one cycle is one side effect, so cancelling cycle N kills side effect N, and discarding the
// coordinator after cycle N is a restart immediately after side effect N committed.
//
// Honest scope, stated up front rather than buried:
//   - The workload is smaller than Section 12's: 4 paced clients (~50 iterations/s each, four
//     operations per iteration) rather than 8 clients at 10 rps, and each barrier is held for 3
//     seconds rather than 60. Every barrier still clears more than 1,000 operations and many
//     audit intervals.
//   - The assigned database is a single PostgreSQL database, so the topology is unified and
//     carries exactly ONE marker key. Partial-marker qualification needs split mode (AUTO-T17).
//   - Only PostgreSQL is covered here; the MySQL half of the matrix is another file.
//
// COMPACT_UUID_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN and COMPACT_UUID_TEST_OLD_BINARY gate these tests. A missing
// variable skips locally so an ordinary `go test ./...` still passes on a laptop; CI's no-skip
// guard fails the run instead of letting it go green.

// compactFaultRunCycle runs exactly one real coordinator cycle under a real ownership claim.
//
// A contended acquisition is retried within the resumption budget the proposal itself grants a
// restarted owner — one lock timeout plus one active interval (AUTO-T32; section 8.6 likewise
// allows "within one active interval"). The budget is not leniency, it is the realistic model:
// when a kill lands inside a previous acquisition, that owner's pinned connection is discarded
// and PostgreSQL releases its advisory lock when the backend exits, which is asynchronous by a
// few milliseconds. A restarted process cannot possibly reacquire before the server reaps its
// predecessor, and demanding that it do so fails the harness on physics rather than on product
// behavior. The bound still catches the real defect this sweep once found: a lock stranded on a
// connection returned ALIVE to the pool never clears, so the retry loop still times out and
// fails loudly.
// Parameters:
//   - ctx: context bounding the cycle; cancelling it is how this suite kills the owner.
//   - coordinator: coordinator under test.

// Return values:
//   - compactCycleResult: the cycle's result.

// compactRegistry sorts targets by (role, table, legacyColumn), so users.inviter_uuid is

// row budget in that order and breaks when it is spent, while reconcileCompactTarget

// every subsequent cycle. users.inviter_uuid consequently spends the entire global budget every
// cycle, forever, and users.uuid never receives any: its historical rows are never filled,
// validation always reports actionable rows, and no marker is ever written.
